        "'The Doors' were one of the greatest rock and roll bands of the sixties and the quintessential California group of the decade. They so embodied the West Coast counterculture experience that viewing this biographical film about Jim Morrison and The Doors also provides a fascinating view of the cultural and spiritual forces that drove Jim and that entire generation to challenge the status quo of the American mainstream.<br /><br />What exactly is the true story of the life and death of Jim Morrison? Is it the story of one of the many rebellious young adults of the time who in looking for an alternative way of living got lost along the way in the drugs, alcohol and sexual freedom that so dominated that culture? Or is Jims' story a deeply mystical tale announcing the rebirth of ancient shamanism into the collective consciousness of the twentieth century? The story of someone chosen by the spirits to bring the 'old ways' to a new generation looking for something to fill the spiritual void brought about by the loss of belief in the Christian God?<br /><br />Director Oliver Stone has played the mythmaker to perfection in this amazing film providing us with the unique experience of entering into the American Dreamtime. Layering mundane worldly events intermitently with glimpses of the psychic, shamanic forces motivating those events we are given the opportunity to chose for ourselves what level of reality we are willing, or ready to accept. A truly remarkable accomplishment.<br /><br />As for the performance of Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison, it couldn't have been better. His ability to capture both the physcial appearance and dark persona of the legendary rock star so completely is beyond extraordinary. Without question Val was born to play this role.<br /><br />Did Jim really believe he was the \"Electric Shaman\" called by the spirits to open the \"Doors of Perception\" to a sleeping world? Was he Dionysus reborn, here to use his suggestive music and lyrics to arouse his followers and bring to fruition his new 'Rites of Spring' with \"Golden copulations in the streets of L.A.\" More likely he was playing the part of the mischevious Indian 'Trickster' leading us once again in the wrong direction. Maybe it's just like his Mother said long ago while the old Indian lay dying along the roadside in the California desert. \"It's just a dream Jimmy, that's all it is.\"<br /><br />So relax, show no fear, \"Kiss the Snake\" and enjoy the ride!\n",

She certainly made it watchable for me.<br /><br />Make no mistake, you're watching this movie for one reason and one reason only.

For most of the film the terror and dread is psychological in nature and proceeds from an intelligent storyline and a thought-provoking script which dialogues with the audience on such concerns as the nature of life, death and what a person would be willing to do to retain ones life.<br /><br />For me what really makes the film work is the protagonist nicknamed Jigsaw. While his actions are indeed horrific and grotesque his reasoning comes across as rational, his goals subtle and his attention to detail flawless. Well worth a watch, or two.<br /><br />My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-.\n",

        "\"So This Is Love\" ~ Disney Moves Into The Fifties\n",
        "`Cinderella' was released in '50 to a film going audience hungering for another animated Disney film to follow-up the highly successful `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' some thirteen years earlier. While the movie was a hit amongst its target audience in my estimation it didn't display any vast improvement over the earlier film. The animation was much the same, the characters continued to be one-dimensional, the villainess didn't match the intensity of evil as the previous and while the soundtrack was quite good the songs weren't as memorable as those in Snow White.<br /><br />`Cinderella' does however have its moments, the best being those featuring her two little mouse friends and helpers Jaques and Gus. For me Gus-Gus saves this film and makes it enjoyable for an adult audience.<br /><br />Not Disney's best but as all Disney features go, it has its own loyal audience which I'm sure runs in the millions.\n",

        "\"Faith Is A Gift I Have Yet To Receive\" ~ Where Are The Angels And Demons?\n",
        "Released in 2009, 'Angels and Demons' is director Ron Howard's second cinematic installment chronicling the adventures of Harry Langdon (Tom Hanks), symbolist extraordinaire. As in the 'Da Vinci Code' the bad guy is once again ensconced within Vatican walls and protected by churchly robes akin to wolves in sheeps clothing. Do you think maybe Dan Brown has an axe to grind? Be that as it may a movie is modern storytelling and the important question is did you enjoy the tale?<br /><br />I found the film somewhat a disappointment. It was a case of alot of glitz but no substance. The production values are first rate with an accomplished cast to match and the central character Harry Langdon is more complex and fascinating than, dare I say it, Indiana Jones (did I just hear thunder from on high). Yet with that said I must also say that I never got caught up in the story. There was no emotional connection, no pounding heartbeat, no anticipation of what was going to happen next. In the final analysis I felt cheated and I'm still wondering where are the angels and demons mentioned in the title? If they had stayed with the European title, 'Illuminati' at least it would have been an honest reflection of what the film was about.\n",

        "The `Da Vinci Code' is one of those love it, or hate it films. I will openly admit here and now at the beginning of my review that my opinion is somewhat biased by the fact that I just love this mystico/spiritual, conspiracy type of material, so there was little doubt I was going to enjoy the movie no matter what. The subject matter alone earns this film an unqualified 3 Stars.<br /><br />With 288 reviews on-line to date there's no need for me to give a synopsis. I would however like to say that upon viewing the film I found myself quite pleased with the end result. Production values, cinematography, acting and script were first rate as all Ron Howard productions are. While the film may not have lived up to expectations placed on it by many, especially those who read the novel, I do think it has accomplished its goal and will generate a great deal of late night conversation and re-evaluation of personal paradigms and long held beliefs. That in itself makes this film a worthwhile watch.\n",

        "Released in '93 the film `Rudy' is without question one of the most loved sports films of all-time. Based on the true story of Rudy Ruettiger and his vision quest to play football for the Fighting Irish at the University of Notre Dame, it's a story that Sean Astin was born to bring alive on film. He's absolutely perfect as the not so talented athlete with an unquenchable spirit that will not be denied.<br /><br />This movie certainly knows how to push all the right emotional buttons just when needed and the superb production values and soundtrack create a wonderfully inspiring and nostalgic atmosphere that will pull on the heartstrings of even the most cynical amongst us. If you're a sports fan or not you'll certainly enjoy Sean Astin's magnificent performance.<br /><br />My Rating: -4 1/2 Stars-.\n",

        "When you think of director Cecil B. DeMille the word epic immediately comes to mind. It has now been exactly fifty years since the '56 release of `The Ten Commandments' yet it still remains one of the greatest film epics, especially religious themed epics, of all time. Yes it is somewhat dated by its stiff posturing and over-the-top acting by some of the cast (in particular I'm thinking of the lovely Anne Baxter and Debra Paget). The intermittent narration that takes place throughout the movie is also a little disconcerting and gives the film an almost Sunday School feel at times. However the sets and costumes are fabulous, the special effects more than acceptable and Charlton Heston makes for a intimidating Moses while Yul Brynner is perfect as his adopted brother and adversary Rameses I.<br /><br />One of the big attractions in this film is the fact that the cast is a veritable \"Who's Who\" list featuring many of the greatest names in the industry from the forties, some a little earlier. It's worth watching just to see so many famous personalities together in one motion picture. It also contains a marvelous soundtrack by the incomparable composer Elmer Bernstein.\n",

        "\"You, They Know About You\" ~ The Peril Of Looking Too Closely\n",
        "\"You, they know about you.\" This may be the most chilling line of dialogue ever delivered on film. It is the pivotal moment in the movie, the moment of realization that not everything we see is real. Whether we want to belief it or not, forces exist in the universe that we dismiss or ignore at our own peril.<br /><br />Such is the moment of truth for Jean-Charles Pommier (Pierce Brosnan), a sophisticated, well respected anthropologist newly arrived in Los Angeles and about to embark on a new phase in his career as a professor of Cultural Anthropology at UCLA. After years of living in some of the most remote regions of the world studying the spiritual beliefs and customs of nomadic cultures, Jean-Charles is reluctant but willing to leave the  spiritual cosmos of the 'primitive' for a better life with his wife in sunny California.<br /><br />He soon discovers that things are no different in the urban sprawl of a major city than they are anywhere else. The very first day in their new home Pommier encounters a troublesome, unruly band of misfits driving around the neighborhood in a black van. Curious about their anti-social behavior he follows them about Westwood secretly taking notes and photos of their activities. His findings are unexpected and earthshattering. They are Nomads (hostile, wandering spirits),  and his interest in them has now turned their attention in his direction. The hunter has become the hunted and poor Jean-Charles must attempt to flee from the Nomads before it's too late.<br /><br />Wonderful performances abound in this film. Pierce Brosnan and Lesley-Anne Down (as Dr. Eileen Flax) are at their best in the lead roles, but it is the supporting cast that really takes this film to a higher level. Anna Maria Monticelli is absolutely beautiful as Pommiers' loving, vulernable wife while Jeannie Elias supplies a Streisandesque burst of energy and a little comic relief as the hardnosed, agnostic best friend of Dr. Flax. Frances Bay who delivers that crucial line of dialogue at the beginning of this review has a small but significant role that she plays to eerie perfection.<br /><br />There are also amazing performances to be found by those in the role of the Nomads. They don't speak a word yet have the uncanny ability to create the most disquieting, otherworldly atmosphere with nothing more than a facial expression or gesture. They're absolutely mesmerizing. Adam Ant as \"Number One\", Mary Woronov as \"Dancing Mary\" and Hector Mercado as \"Ponytail\" are unforgetable.<br /><br />Every movie fan knows that the soundtrack plays a major role in the success or failure of a film to create the appropriate mood, or elicit the desired emotional response from the audience. In 'Nomads' Bill Conti and Ted Nuggent have provided the perfect accompaniment, successfully capturing the angry, restless nature of these hostile entities in their hard-driving, discordant rhythms. Like an incessant, demonic heartbeat the thundering music and lyrics of Ted Nuggent coupled with the etheral, exotic sounds of Bill Conti envelope the viewer drawing them into the savage, archaic Underworld of the Nomads.<br /><br />Departing from the usual action/adventure features he's so well known for, director John McTiernan delivers a stunning masterpiece of psychological, supernatural terror. Nomads is as near perfect as a movie could be. However I will admit if you have a problem with non-linear story lines, or you're not familiar with such esoteric subject matters as territorial spirits and shamanic transference it might be at times a little difficult to follow. Believe me it's worth the effort to stay with it. If you don't understand something just watch it again, you'll be surprised at the depth of the film and what subtle insights you missed during your previous viewing! Needless to say 'Nomads' is without a doubt one of my all-time favorite films!\n",

        "\"COME INTO ME!\"  ~  Perceiving The Metaphysical Landscape\n",
        "What is it about this 1973 film dealing with the subject of demonic possession that still has such a tight grip on our collective imaginations? Now some thirty years after its theatrical release it still warrants enough interest to generate over 700 reviews on Amazon.com.<br /><br />It certainly isn't just the special effects, which are quite good, because they can easily be outdone with today's technology. Nor can it be explained away by pointing to societies perverse fascination with grotesque images, foul language and projectile pea soup. It's not even the excellent cast, director (William Friedkin) or production values that make this one of the most gripping, unforgettable treatments of spiritual evil ever captured on film.<br /><br />I think the secret is found in something unspoken, but heard nonetheless. Something hinted at on-screen only in fleeting images that remain with us long after they've vanished into the darkness. This \"Unspoken Something\" I'm referring to is perfectly captured in the opening prologue of the film, that moment at the archeological dig site in Iraq.<br /><br />Prologue: As the sun sets on the far horizon Father Lankester Merrin finds himself alone. A moment later a pack of dogs begin to growl and fight amongst the ruins just as the wind picks up and swirls of red dust fill the air. Father Merrin realizes he is no longer alone. On a nearby mound stands a statue, a ancient representation of a powerful demon known to the Assyrians and Babylonians as Pazuzu. Merrin stands motionless as he looks deeply into the features of his adversary. They have met before. The essence of this film is encapsulated in this brief moment of realization. The battle for a human soul is about to begin.\n",

See Elvis win the heart of many a fair maiden with his classic good looks, charming personality, manly fighting skills and incredible singing voice. However what sets this particular film apart from the rest of the herd of Elvis cinematic exploits is the presence of one of the most stunning beauties of the `60's, or any decade for that matter, the alluring, rarely seen Jocelyn Lane. For me this isn't an Elvis film, it's a Jocelyn Lane film and the - 4 Stars - are all for her.\n",

        "'Animal House' released in '78 is an irreverent, depraved and sporadically humorous comedy about the fraternity life of a group of college underachievers and degenerates in search of easy women and their next beer. It's the movie that launched myriads of Toga Parties far and wide across the American landscape back in the late '70's and early '80's.<br /><br />Lots of funny stuff in this film, some not so funny stuff as well. The best moments clearly belong to the late John Belushi in his signature role as John 'Bluto' Blutarsky. Without his performance I don't think 'Animal House' would have received the love and acclaim it has through the years.<br /><br />National Lampoon took a big risk in producing this taboo breaking movie and it was the success of 'Animal House' that opened the doors to the flood of teen coming of age films to follow.\n",

        "The highly controversial '88 release of Martin Scorsese's 'The Last Temptation of Christ' simply didn't live up to expectations. Based on the classic novel by Nikos Kazantzakis, this film was not only a failure at the box office, but also failed as a faithful presentation of Kazantzakis literary masterpiece.<br /><br />The book is poetic, esoteric, surreal and highly hallucinogenic in nature. It appears that Scorsese was unable to capture the spiritual beauty, intensity and multi-textured message of this classic composition and opted for an opposite approach. The film is primitive, earthy and disturbingly barbaric and bloody. His stark, linear vision for this project may have had some limited success artistically but in my opinion did not correspond effectively with the loftier Theological and philosophical concepts revealed in Kazantzakis writings.<br /><br />It's much easier to embrace Scorsese's cinematic interpretation if you haven't read the book. The film is extremely exotic and perversely alluring with an intriquing artsy quality surfacing now and then. Conversely it's also surprisingly uneven and mundane at times with some incredibly slow sections that are difficult to endure. Fortunately I think the last thirty minutes of the film finally connects with Kazantzakis' vision and redeems the film, rewarding the stalwart viewer for the effort spent. 'The Last Temptation of Christ' just might appeal to those tired of the traditional versions of the Jesus Mythos.<br /><br />William Dafoe gives a credible performance as Jesus as does Harvey Keitel in the role of Judas, however the real treasure in this production is the excellent soundtrack by Peter Gabriel.<br /><br />Final Analysis: The film fails as a trustworthy adaptation of the book, but succeeds marginally at providing a stark and uncertain alternative exploration into the mind of Jesus, the God-man.<br /><br />Worthy of seeing at least once. As for repeat viewings, you decide.\n",

        "\"Gone, Gone, Gone Beyond, Gone Altogether Beyond\" ~ The Quest For Harmony And Happiness While Dealing With Impermanence\n",
        "Synopsis: Have you ever wondered why the Chinese tend to have red front doors? It's because red is the color that attracts harmony and happiness to the occupants within, that's why. With that bit of information in mind the audience is now armed with a little insight into what lies ahead.  The '06 cinematic release `Red Doors' is a gem of a film about a Chinese-American family that has lost their harmony, happiness and family connectedness despite the bright red front door and the porcelain Kwan Yin displayed in the dinning room. This familial unrest and discord is subtly and symbolically presented to the viewer at the beginning of the story as we see a seemingly happy family dinner coming to an end. As Samantha, the oldest of three daughters leaves the table she accidently bumps the Kwan Yin statue off a nearby cabinet. The shattering of the beloved and compassionate Goddess who also bestows \"harmony and happiness\" to those who honor her immediately informs us that things are not as they should be.<br /><br />The problems within this quiet home have come to a head with the retirement of Ed (Tzi Ma), husband and father of the household. He has already lost the time and attention of his daughters that he so much enjoyed when they were young. Life doesn't stand still, things change and so has the mode of communication between Samantha (Jacqueline Kim), Julie (Elaine Kao) and Katie (Kathy Shao-Lin Lee). Now busy with their lives outside the house they've lost the close relationship they once had with their aging parents. Sadly, the only time Ed smiles is when he's alone watching old VHS tapes of the children. In his self-imposed silence Ed desperately seeks a way out. Numerous attempts at suicide have failed due to interruptions or ineptness however when he discovers that a large Buddhist monastery is nearby in leaves a cryptic goodbye note on his computer and disappears. As his wife and daughters deal with the situation and try to make sense of what's happened they slowly begin to look within to discern where their happiness lies and discover what they must do to make their hopes and dreams come true.<br /><br />Critique: I absolutely love this film, it reminds me quite a bit of `The Joy Luck Club' and even more so `Eat Drink Man Woman' (Chinese with English subtitles). Everything is right on the money with this movie; production values, soundtrack, storyline and dialogue. As for the cast, well that's the best part. The chemistry between them makes you believe they're a real family. This is one I could watch over and over again!<br /><br />Postscript: Have you pondered the reason why the title of the film is `Red Doors', not `Red Door', after all a house has only one front entrance doesn't it? Maybe I just enjoy over analyzing things but I think it's yet another subtle reminder that harmony and happiness comes from within. Each of us has our own metaphorical red door to discover.  When we find it and open ourselves to its power all is right in the world.\n",

Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil) is back once again doing what she does best, terminate evil.<br /><br />Set far into the future, after most of mankind has been wiped out by a devastating biological holocaust those that remain have been divided into two warring camps, humans and hemophages.

        "`The Hawk Is Dying' released in '05 is a small budget film that relies almost entirely on the talents of Paul Giamatti in the starring role to generate and sustain the prerequisite energy and focus to keep the audience entertained throughout.<br /><br />Synopsis: Giamatti plays the part of George Gattling owner of a local auto custom shop and would be hawk trainer. His aspirations to train this wild spirited bird stems from a deep seeded desire to set himself apart from his lower, middle class existence and like the hawk rise above the normal scheme of things and feel alive and free for the first time in his life. When a loved one unexpectedly dies his need to accomplish his dream escalates and becomes a do or die situation for both him and his recently captured prey.<br /><br />Critique: Yes, Giamatti has proven himself to be a superior actor and this role only further proves that point. However even an actor of his caliber can only do so much with a storyline primarily consisting of him with a bird of prey attached to his arm. The tale is obviously allegorical and the hawk symbolic of something beyond what is seen on the surface. I'm sure numerous deep thinking viewers will have a great time discussing the layers of meaning over expresso after watching. Bottom line, `The Hawk Is Dying' is worth one viewing, but that's about it.\n",

        "\"What Haunts A Man The Most?\" ~ Actions Speak Louder Than Words\n",
        "Synopsis: Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a bitter, aging Archie Bunker-like Korean War veteran and widower who seems to hate just about everybody and everything. That is with the exception of his '72 Gran Torino. When he finds himself pulled into a gang related situation terrorizing his Asian neighbors he finds himself invested and connected to others for the first time since the death of his wife and reevaluates his life and what he should do to better things for the neighborhood.<br /><br />Critique: 'Gran Torino' is a hard hitting contemporary drama that mirrors many of the attitudes and social problems plaquing American urban society; loneliness, ignorance, racism, uninvolvement, hostility and gang violence to name a few. Clint Eastwood delivers one of his best film performances (my personal favorite is 'Pale Rider'). The dialogue is sharp and bitting, the storyline edgy and contemporary and the acting is honest and believable. This is hard-hitting cinema that is both enjoyable and meaningful. Recommended viewing.\n",
